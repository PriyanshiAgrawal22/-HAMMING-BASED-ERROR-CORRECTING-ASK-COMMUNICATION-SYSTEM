# -HAMMING-BASED-ERROR-CORRECTING-ASK-COMMUNICATION-SYSTEM
∗ TechStack: Verilog, Xilinx Vivado, EDA Playground

∗ Hamming (7,4) Encoding and Decoding: Implemented error-control coding to encode 4-bit data into 7-bit
Hamming code using calculated parity bits and later decoded the corrected data to retrieve the original input.

∗ Noise Addition : Simulated a noisy channel by manually introducing single-bit and multi-bit errors to test the
robustness of the error detection and correction mechanism.

∗ ASK Modulation and Demodulation: Transmitted encoded data using Amplitude Shift Keying, mapping digital
bits to signal amplitudes and accurately recovering them through demodulation.

∗ Syndrome Checking and Error Detection/Correction : Used syndrome bits to identify the location of a singlebit error and correct it. Detected two-bit errors and parity mismatch errors to ensure system reliability.
